# json-plugin
The JSON plugin adds a series of native functions that enable easy reading and parsing of external JSON data files.

This plugin uses the [vJSON](https://github.com/vivkin/vjson) project for parsing.

## Natives
See [a_json.pwn](server/a_json.pwn) for the native functions exposed by this plugin, and a generic explanation on how to use this plugin.
